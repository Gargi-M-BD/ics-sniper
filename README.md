The pcap files captured from the testbeds are too large to be uploaded to Github.
We will upload the pcap files at a separate non-anonymized G-Drive location once the paper is accepted.
However, we open-source the Python implementation of the pattern mining algorithm in the paper, along with the relevant data extracted from the pcap files. For demonstration, we use the pcap data from the setup with the highest security measure, i.e., VPN.
